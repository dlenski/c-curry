/* This program demonstrates how to curry a 2-parameter function into
 * a 1-parameter function, in C, for the x86-64 architecture and
 * System V ABI.
 *
 * It is based on the "Trampoline Illustration" from
 * https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/11/15, but with the trampoline
 * stored on the heap rather than the stack. This is much safer
 * because it means we don't have to disable the compiler's stack
 * execution protection (no 'gcc -Wl,-z,execstack').
